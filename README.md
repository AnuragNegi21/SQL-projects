# SQL-projects
This project involves the creation of a structured SQL database to store and manage information about books the user has read. The database, named 'books_read', includes essential details such as the title, author, genre, year read, personal rating, and Goodreads rating of each book. The database schema was designed to ensure easy access and querying of book-related data, allowing for detailed tracking and analysis of reading habits over time. Additionally, this project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for organizing and manipulating book data, providing a foundational structure that can be expanded for further applications such as book recommendation systems or reading trend analysis.
